HiðŸ‘‹ I'm ChungHa, a third-year Ph.D. student at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), South Korea.


Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on designing and developing research prototypes, mostly focusing on website design and front-end development for web-based platforms. Nowadays, I focus on research in **information accessibility, creativity support tools, and interaction design**. 

I enjoy exploring research questions using a mix of quantitative methods, like surveys, and qualitative approaches, such as interviews and observational studies.

If youâ€™re curious about my work, feel free to check out my **[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_CSwBPEAAAAJ&hl=en)** and my **[resume](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19310465/resume_chunghalee.pdf)**. Thanks for stopping by!
