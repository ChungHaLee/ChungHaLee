HiðŸ‘‹ I'm ChungHa, a third-year Ph.D. student at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), South Korea.

I am interested in research areas such as information accessibility, creativity support tools, and interaction design. 
I have experience designing and developing research prototypes, primarily focusing on website design and front-end development in web-based platforms. 
Also, I enjoy validating research questions through a mix of quantitative studies using surveys and qualitative research methods like interviews and observational studies.

Feel free to explore more of my research on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_CSwBPEAAAAJ&hl=en). Thank you!
