Hi👋 I'm ChungHa, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), South Korea.


Over the years, I’ve worked on designing and developing research prototypes, mostly focusing on website design and front-end development for web-based platforms. Nowadays, I focus on research in **information accessibility, creativity support tools, and mostly, interaction design**. 

I enjoy exploring research questions using a mix of quantitative methods, like surveys, and qualitative approaches, such as interviews and observational studies.

If you’re curious about my work, feel free to check out my **[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_CSwBPEAAAAJ&hl=en)** and **[CV (Updated in Feb 09, 2026)](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/25331007/chunghalee_cv_260209.pdf)**. Thanks for stopping by!
